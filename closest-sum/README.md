# Closest Problem

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers, `nums`, and another integer, `target`. Your task is to identify three distinct elements from the array such that their combined sum is as close as possible to the value of `target`.

Your solution should return this closest possible sum of the three elements.

You can assume there is always exactly one unique combination that results in the closest sum.

### Example 1

- **Input:** `nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4]`, `target = 1`
- **Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:** The sum of the three numbers closest to 1 is 2, achieved by the combination `(-1 + 2 + 1 = 2)`.

### Example 2

- **Input:** `nums = [0, 0, 0]`, `target = 1`
- **Output:** `0`
- **Explanation:** The closest sum is `0`, since `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`.
