/* 
    Given an array where the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i, 
    find the maximum profit you can achieve by buying and then selling the stock. 
    You can only complete one transaction. 

    Input: array [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
    Output: max profit to buy and then sell the stock

    Profit: 
        6âˆ’1=5

    Obs: Only one transaction can be done

    Edge case
        argument of the function need to be a array

    Steps
        1 - Create the function that accept a array as argument
        2 - Identify in the array which day is the best day to buy and sell the stock
        3 - Calculate the profit which is Sell - buy
        4 - Return the profit

console.log(buySellStock([10, 5, 3, 2, 1])); // best day to buy is day = 1 price = 1 and best day to sell is day 0 = 0  profit 0
