Problem statement
You are given a positive integer N and an integer K > 1.

For each integer from 1 to N, repeat the following operation:

Divide the integer by K
If the number is divisible, divide by K, and repeat
Otherwise, end the operation.
Let f(n) be the integer after the operation. For example, if n = 12 and K = 3, then f(12) = 4(12â†’4).

Find the sum of all f(n) from 1 to N.

Input: N (Positive integer), K (a positive number always greater than 1 => integer k > 1)
Output: sum of all f(n) from 1 to N

Edge case:
  K needs to be greater than 1
  N needs to be a positive number
  
Test
  k = 4
  n = 10
  
  So, 1+2+3+1+5+6+7+2+9+10=46

  The output should be 46.

Eg.: if the number is divisible by for return the result

Steps
  loop from 1 to n
  in the loop check if the number is divisible by k
  if is divisible repeat the division till the number is not divisible anymore 
  1 = 1/4 = 1 because 1 is not divisible by 4
  2 = 2/4 = 2 because 2 is not divisible by 4
  3 = 3/4 = 3 because 3 is not divisible by 4
  4 = 4/4 = 1 4 is divisible by 4
  5 = 5/4 = 5 because 5 is not divisible by 4
  6 = 6/4 = 6 because 6 is not divisible by 4
  7 = 7/4 = 7 because 7 is not divisible by 4
  8 = 8/4 = 2 because 8 is divisible by 4
  9 = 9/4 = 9 because 9 is not divisible by 4
  10 10 /4 = 10 because 10 is not divisible by 4
