/* 
Problem statement
You are given a positive integer N and an integer K > 1.

For each integer from 1 to N, repeat the following operation:

Divide the integer by K
If the number is divisible, divide by K, and repeat
Otherwise, end the operation.
Let f(n) be the integer after the operation. For example, if n = 12 and K = 3, then f(12) = 4(12â†’4).

Find the sum of all f(n) from 1 to N.

Input: N (Positive integer), K (a positive number always greater than 1 => integer k > 1)
Output: sum of all f(n) from 1 to N

Edge case:
  K needs to be greater than 1
  N needs to be a positive number
  
Test
  k = 4
  n = 10
  
  So, 1+2+3+1+5+6+7+2+9+10=46

  The output should be 46.

Steps
